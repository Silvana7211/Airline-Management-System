# Airline-Management-System
The secret to a better service to clients is having a good management system and this is crucial especially about an airline which has a lot of departments and workers to coordinate. The purpose of our project is to build a platform for the workers of an airline where every worker would have the possibility to log in and access all the data related to him and his position in the company. This platform would help them do their work properly and be always informed about any new changes in the timetable or in their department.
Every manager of the department will have the right to add new workers when someone new is hired and also remove any worker. He will also be capable to decide what data each worker will have access to. 
Our project will consist to a website and an application. The platforms that are going to be used are Django Rest Framework and MySql to work with the database.
