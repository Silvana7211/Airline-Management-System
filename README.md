# Airline-Management-System
Our project's purpose is building a management system for an airline and also building an application for passengers to book their flights, be able to choose the cheapest and shortest route to arrive to the destination and also talk to the airline customer service for any requirement or complaint they may have. The management system tends to involve the whole staff of the Airline where each user will have different actions depending on their position in the company. 
The purpose of this project is to offer an enhanced management system for the airline company which is going to use it, it will make it easier for the managers and every position to have control over their responsibilities and it will give the company the chance to serve better to its customers.
